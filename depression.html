          <h1>What is depression and what can I do about it?</h1>
    
          <p class="lead">Depression is a chronic feeling of emptiness, sadness, or inability to feel pleasure that may appear to happen
            for no clear reason. It is distinct from grief and other emotions.</p>
    
          <p class="lead">Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization
            (WHO).Trusted Source</p>
    
          <p class="lead">It can undermine a person’s relationships, make working and maintaining good health very difficult, and in
            severe cases, may lead to suicide. In fact, depression contributes to nearly 40,000 suicides in the United
            States each year.</p>
    
          <p class="lead">It can affect adults, adolescents, and children. This article examines what depression is and what causes it,
            as well as types of depression, treatment, and more. </p>

          <h2> What is depression?</h2>
    
          <p class="lead"> Depression is a mood disorder that causes persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, and loss of joy. It is
            different from the mood fluctuations that people regularly experience as a part of life.</p>
    
          <p class="lead"> Major life events, such as bereavement or the loss of a job, can triggerTrusted Source depression. But
            depression is distinct from the negative feelings a person may temporarily have in response to a difficult life
            event.</p>
    
          <p class="lead"> Depression often persists in spite of a change of circumstances and causes feelings that are intense, chronic,
            and not proportional to a person’s circumstances.</p>
    
          <p class="lead"> It is an ongoing problem, not a passing one. While there are different types of depression, the most common
            one is major depressive disorder. It consists of episodes during which the symptoms last for at least two
            weeks.Trusted Source</p>
    
          <p class="lead">Depression can last for several weeks, months, or years. For many people, it is a chronic illness that gets
            better and then relapses. </p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
          <h2> Is it curable?</h2>
    
          <p class="lead"> While there is no cure for depression, there are effective treatments that help with recovery. The earlier
            that treatment starts, the more successful it may be. Some people may never experience depression again after a
            single period of it. Others will continue to have relapses.</p>
    
          <p class="lead"> Many people experiencing depression recover after a treatment plan. Even with effective treatment, however, a
            relapse may occur. About halfTrusted Source of people do not initially respond to treatment.</p>
    
          <p class="lead"> To prevent relapse, people who take medication for depression should continue with treatment — even after
            symptoms improve or go away — for as long as their doctor advises.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div>

          </ul>
    
          <p class="lead"> If a person experiences five Trusted Sourceor moreTrusted Source of these symptoms during the same 2-week
            period, a doctor may diagnose them with depression.</p>
    
          <p class="lead"> Depression may also causeTrusted Source other symptoms, including irritability, restlessness, chronic pain,
            headaches, and digestive issues.</p>
