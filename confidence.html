    <h1>Practical Ways How to Build Self-Confidence</h1>
    <div>
      <h2> What is Self-Confidence?:</h2>

      <p class="lead"> Self-confidence is an attitude about your skills and abilities. It means you accept and trust yourself and
        have a sense of control in your life. You know your strengths and weakness well, and have a positive view of
        yourself. You set realistic expectations and goals, communicate assertively, and can handle criticism.</p>

        <p class="lead"> On the other hand, low self-confidence might make you feel full of self-doubt, be passive or submissive, or
        have difficulty trusting others. You may feel inferior, unloved, or be sensitive to criticism. Feeling confident
        in yourself might depend on the situation. For instance, you can feel very confident in some areas, such as
        academics, but lack confidence in others, like relationships.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Having high or low self-confidence is rarely related to your actual abilities, and mostly based on your
        perceptions. Perceptions are the way your think about yourself and these thoughts can be flawed.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Low self-confidence might stem from different experiences, such as growing up in an unsupportive and critical
        environment, being separated from your friends or family for the first time, judging yourself too harshly, or
        being afraid of failure. People with low self-confidence often have errors in their thinking.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Why Self-Confidence Matters:</h2>

      <p class="lead"> Self-confidence is vital in almost every aspect of our lives, yet many people struggle to find it. Sadly, this
        can become a vicious cycle: people who lack self-confidence are less likely to achieve the success that could
        give them more confidence.</p>

        <p class="lead">For example, you may not be inclined to back a project that's pitched by someone who's visibly nervous,
        fumbling, or constantly apologizing. On the other hand, you're persuaded by someone who speaks clearly, holds
        their head high, and answers questions with assurance.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Confident people inspire confidence in others: their audience, their co-workers, their bosses, their
        customers, and their friends. And gaining the confidence of others is one of the key ways to succeed. In the
        following sections, we'll see how you can do this.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> How you can improve your self-confidence:</h2>

      <p class="lead">If building self-confidence is a matter of changing your beliefs about yourself, it’s going to take some work.
        You can say, “I’m good enough, I’m smart enough and, doggone it, people like me” into the mirror every day — and
        it couldn’t hurt — but there are more practical, effective tools you can use, too.</p>

      <strong> <h2>Be ‘hyper honest’ with yourself</h2></strong>

      <p class="lead"> Mr. Houpert suggests being “hyper honest” with yourself as a simple, everyday way to exercise your confidence.
      </p>

      <p class="lead"> “For example, let’s say someone asks you what you do for fun or what you do for a living,” he said. “If you
        find yourself biting your tongue or hiding something, evaluate that. That’s an indication to either stop doing
        that thing or, more likely, accept that part of yourself and own it.”</p>

        <p class="lead"> This doesn’t mean you have to share every part of your personality with everyone you meet. You can share your
        geeky hobbies with your geeky friends but stick to work topics at work. However, you can find someone to share
        yourself with. “When you stop hiding parts of yourself from other people, you’ll find you feel more confident in
        who you are,” Mr. Houpert said.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Try things that make you uncomfortable:</h2>

      <p class="lead"> Stepping outside your comfort zone is, as you might expect, uncomfortable. Mr. Houpert said that’s the point.
      </p>

      <p class="lead"> “Confidence is ultimately about being comfortable in a wide variety of situations that would make most people
        feel uncomfortable,” he said. “So if you stretch your comfort zone every day, very quickly you’ll have a large
        comfort zone and be able to feel more comfortable even when outside of it.”</p>
        <p class="lead"> This can involve more daunting changes, like taking a new job or confronting someone you usually avoid.
        However, it can also take smaller forms, like striking up a conversation with someone new if you’re normally
        shy, or trying a new food. According to Mr. Houpert, it’s more important that you regularly expand your comfort
        zone rather than occasionally throwing yourself into the deep end.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Three Ways to Build Your Confidence:</h2>

      <p class="lead"> While there are quick fixes to address acute issues with your self-confidence, building confidence in the long
        term requires making some changes to your lifestyle and forming robust plans. Here are three ways to do that:
      </p>

      <strong> <h2>1. Build Confident Habits:</h2></strong>

      <p class="lead"> To develop and improve your self-esteem, aim to develop good habits – and break bad ones! Regular exercise and
        a healthy diet can dramatically improve your physical and mental health.
        And studies have shown that getting a good night's sleep is linked with increased optimism and self-esteem.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Working on your personal branding can also help. If you project a positive image of your authentic self,
        you'll likely start to receive the positive feedback that's so important to your self-confidence.</p>

      <strong><h2>2. Review Past Achievements</h2> </strong>

      <p class="lead"> Your self-confidence will increase when you're able to say, "I can do this, and here's the evidence." As part
        of your Personal SWOT Analysis, you'll have identified things that you're good at, based on your past
        achievements.</p>

        <p class="lead"> List the 10 things that you're most proud of in an "achievement log." Then use them to make positive
        affirmations about what you can do. These statements are particularly powerful if you tend to undermine your
        confidence with negative self-talk.</p>

      <strong> <h2>3. Set Confidence-Boosting Goals</h2></strong>
<h2></h2>
      <p class="lead"> Setting and achieving goals – and seeing how far you've come – are key ways to develop self-confidence Use
        your Personal SWOT Analysis to set goals that play to your strengths, minimize your weaknesses, and take
        advantage of your opportunities.</p>

        <p class="lead"> When you've identified the major goals you want to achieve, clarify the first steps you need to take. Make
        sure that they're small steps, taking no longer than an hour to do. This will get the ball rolling and improve
        your confidence through the achievement of appropriate goals.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2> Popular Theories of Self-Confidence</h2>

      <p class="lead"> With these definitions in hand, we can take a closer look at common beliefs and popular theories surrounding
        self-confidence and self-esteem.</p>

        <p class="lead">As noted earlier, Branden’s theory of self-esteem became a widely referenced and understood theory, but there
        were also other theories and frameworks for understanding self-esteem in the psychological literature.</p>

      <strong> <h2>Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs:</h2></strong>

      <p class="lead"> Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, an iconic although somewhat out-of-date framework in psychology, theorizes that
        there are several needs that humans must have met to be truly fulfilled, but, generally, the most basic needs
        must be met before more complex needs can be met (1943). In his pyramid, self-esteem is the second highest level
        of need, just under self-actualization.</p>

        <p class="lead">According to Maslow, humans must have their needs of physiological stability, safety, love and belonging met
        before they can develop healthy self-esteem. He also noted that there are two kinds of self-esteem, a “higher”
        and a “lower,” the lower self-esteem derived from the respect of others, while the higher self-esteem comes from
        within.</p>

        <p class="lead">In the years following his introduction of the hierarchy of needs, Maslow refined his theory to accommodate
        the instances of highly self-actualized people who are homeless or individuals who live in a dangerous area or
        war zone but are also high in self-esteem.</p>

        <p class="lead"> This hierarchy is no longer considered as a strict theory of unidirectional growth, but a more general
        explanation of how basic needs being met allow individuals the freedom and ability to achieve their more complex
        ones.</p>

      <strong> <h2>Terror Management Theory:</h2></strong>

      <p class="lead">A darker theory that delves a bit deeper into the human experience to explain self-confidence is the Terror
        Management Theory.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Terror Management Theory (TMT) is based on the idea that humans hold great potential for responding with
        terror to the awareness of their own mortality, and that worldviews that emphasize peoples’ beliefs in their own
        significance as humans protect them against this terror (Greenberg & Arndt, 2011).</p>

        <p class="lead"> TMT posits that self-esteem forms as a way to protect and buffer against anxiety, and subsequently, people
        strive for self-confidence and react negatively to anyone or anything that could undermine their beliefs in
        their comforting worldview.</p>

      <strong> <h2>Sociometer Theory:</h2></strong>

      <p class="lead">Mark Leary, a social psychologist who researches self-esteem in the context of evolutionary psychology, also
        contributed a theory of self-esteem to the literature.</p>

        <p class="lead">The Sociometer Theory suggests that self-esteem is an internal gauge of the degree to which one is included
        vs. excluded by others (Leary, 2006). This theory rests on the conception of self-esteem as an internal
        individual perception of social acceptance and rejection.</p>

        <p class="lead">There is some strong evidence for the accuracy and applicability of this theory. For example, studies have
        shown that the outcomes of events on people’s self-esteem generally match up with their assumptions about how
        the same events would cause other people to accept or reject them (Leary, Tambor, Terdal, & Downs, 1995).</p>

        <p class="lead">Finally, evidence shows that social exclusion based on personal characteristics decreases self-esteem (Leary
        et al., 1995).</p>
